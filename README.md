# post-app

Mini App made with VUE.js Frontend framework in order to learn and test the framework.

App can be tested on this github pages [link](https://villelaraujo.github.io/post-app).

# Notes
The app is far from complete and provides basic functionality and UI design.
You can enter the communities and post, search communities and post by keywords separated by spaces.
Change your username in Settings page.
The app is yet stateless and no database is connected yet, so the posts are not saved. This is to be implemented in the future.
